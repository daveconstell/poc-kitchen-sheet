# Kitchen Sheet BDD Specifications

This directory contains Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) specifications for the Kitchen Sheet application, written in Gherkin language.

## Overview

These specifications describe the expected behavior of the Kitchen Sheet application from a user's perspective. They follow the Given-When-Then format of Gherkin language, which makes them readable by both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## Files

-   **index.spec.md**: Specifications for the main event dashboard, including event card display, filtering, and navigation
-   **kitchen-kanban.spec.md**: Specifications for the kitchen production kanban board, including table/kanban views, filtering, and task management
-   **banquete.spec.md**: Specifications for the banqueting event planning sheet, including event details, space and product management
-   **common.spec.md**: Specifications for functionality common to all pages, such as navigation, styling, and responsive behavior

## Purpose

These BDD specifications serve multiple purposes:

1. **Documentation**: They document how the application should behave from a user's perspective
2. **Requirements**: They act as living requirements that can be updated as the project evolves
3. **Testing**: They can be used as a basis for manual testing or automated acceptance tests
4. **Communication**: They facilitate communication between developers, testers, and stakeholders

## Gherkin Format

The specifications follow the Gherkin syntax:

-   **Feature**: A high-level description of a software feature
-   **Background**: Steps that are run before each scenario
-   **Scenario**: A specific use case or behavior
-   **Given**: The initial context
-   **When**: An action that occurs
-   **Then**: The expected outcome
-   **And**: Additional context, actions, or outcomes

## Current vs. Planned Functionality

These specifications include both:

-   **Current functionality**: Features that are already implemented in the application
-   **Planned functionality**: Features that are intended to be implemented in future iterations

This approach allows the specifications to serve as both documentation of the current state and a roadmap for future development.

## Usage

These specifications can be used in several ways:

1. **Manual Testing**: Testers can use these specifications as a guide for manual testing
2. **Automated Testing**: These specifications can be implemented as automated tests using tools like Cucumber
3. **Development Guide**: Developers can use these specifications to understand what functionality needs to be implemented
4. **Acceptance Criteria**: Product owners can use these specifications to verify that the application meets requirements

## Maintenance

As the application evolves, these specifications should be updated to reflect changes in functionality. This ensures that the specifications remain a reliable source of truth for the application's behavior.
